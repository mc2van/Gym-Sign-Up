# Gym-Sign-Up
## Usage
After installation, follow step one BEFORE the slot is to open, giving you enough time to manually bypass 2FA. Then, when the slot opens, follow step 2.
1. Use your Waterloo email ID and password inputted (do not exit the browser that is opened). Then, authenticate the 2FA as needed.
2. Execute Part2 (will use the same browser as before so as to mitigate 2FA again), which will automatically fill out and check out the gym slot.
